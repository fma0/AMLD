# Algorithmic decision-making in neuroscience: how can we improve algorithmic interpretability and reduce bias?

Welcome! Here you can find notebooks for the workshop [Algorithmic decision-making in neuroscience: how can we improve algorithmic interpretability and reduce bias?](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-epfl-2022/workshops/algorithmic-decision-making-in-neuroscience-how-can-we-improve-algorithmic-interpretability-and-reduce-bias), at the [Applied Machine Learning Days 2022](https://appliedmldays.org/events/amld-epfl-2022/).

### Workshop notes
Course notes can be found [here](https://yopad.eu/p/AMLD2022_Neuroscience-365days)

### Data
The data file '817_1_PDDys_ODDBALL_Clean_curated.fif' was originally part of the [Patient Repository for EEG data and computational tools](http://predict.cs.unm.edu/) website, where it was part of the [Parkinson's Oddball](http://bit.ly/2r4JORe) dataset. The publication describing this dataset [can be found here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388245717311719).

### Toolboxes used
This course is mainly based on [MNE-Python](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python) and [Scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).

### Tutorials
Some introductory tutorial notebooks on handling EEG data and Machine Learning with EEG data can [be found here](https://github.com/aath0/PIP_SummerSchoolML/tree/master/TutorialNotebooks).

### Student Projects
During the course students can work on their own short projects.
